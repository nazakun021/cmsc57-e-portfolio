                    <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> It's funny how even seemingly simple scenarios can involve a good deal of combinatorial thinking. Makes you realize there's more than meets the eye.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Determining the number of possible license plates or phone numbers.</p>
                    <p><strong>Learnings:</strong> I learned about the product rule, the sum rule, and tree diagrams.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> These principles are foundational to all combinatorics problems we tackled later in the course.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>B. Pigeonhole Principle</h3>
                <div class="section">
                    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> It was genuinely surprising to see how such a simple piece of logic can definitively prove that repetition must occur in certain sets. It's very straightforward.</p>
                    <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> This topic really made me appreciate the profound depth that can hide behind seemingly simple ideas.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Proving that in any group of 367 people, at least two share a birthday.</p>
                    <p><strong>Learnings:</strong> I learned that if you have more pigeons than pigeonholes, some must share.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This concept isn't just a neat trick; it's incredibly crucial in fields like probability and when trying to optimize solutions to various problems.</p>

                    <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Having to account for repeated elements and various constraints definitely added a new layer of challenge, but it was a good one.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Calculating the number of distinct arrangements of letters in a word with repeated letters (e.g., "MISSISSIPPI").</p>
                    <p><strong>Learnings:</strong> Adjusting formulas to consider identical items is key.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is super important when you're trying to model real-world situations, like figuring out possible codes or unique arrangements where some items aren't distinct.</p>
                </div>
                <h3>E. Generating Permutations and Combinations</h3>
                <div class="section">
                    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> There was something incredibly satisfying about learning how to programmatically generate all possible outcomes.</p>
                    <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> I really appreciated seeing the algorithmic side of these counting problems; it bridged the gap between abstract concepts and concrete computation.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Creating all possible lottery number combinations for analysis.</p>
                    <p><strong>Learnings:</strong> Recursive and iterative methods can systematically solve such problems.</p>

                    <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Thinking about strong versus weak connections, and what it takes to break a graph apart, really helps define how robust or fragile different systems might be.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Analyzing the reliability of communication networks (e.g., internet, phone networks).</p>
                    <p><strong>Learnings:</strong> Connected graphs ensure every vertex can reach another.</p>
                    <p><strong>Analysis:</strong> This is super important for designing and maintaining fault-tolerant systems, where you need things to keep working even if some parts fail.</p>

                    <p><strong>Reflection:</strong> Planarity introduced a fascinating visual and geometric dimension to graph theory. It's about whether you can draw a graph without lines crossing.</p>
                    <p><strong>Thoughts:</strong> Kuratowski's Theorem, which gives a condition for when a graph is *not* planar, was a particularly interesting and powerful result to learn about.</p>
                    <p><strong>Application:</strong> Designing printed circuit boards (PCBs) to avoid crossing connections.</p>
                    <p><strong>Learnings:</strong> Planar graphs can be drawn without edge crossings.</p>
